# Full-Stack-Movie-Review-Java-Application

Target Technologies:

MongoDB for the Database:

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON.
It is often used in full-stack applications for its scalability and ease of integration with various programming languages.
Java and Spring Boot for the Backend:

Java is a widely used, versatile programming language.
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Java programming language. It simplifies the process of building production-ready applications with Java.
Together, Java and Spring Boot are commonly used to create robust and scalable backend services in web development.
React for the Frontend:

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications where the user interacts with the page without reloading it.
It allows developers to build reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface in response to data changes.
Project Overview:

Movie Review Application:
The course focuses on building a movie review application, suggesting that users will be able to review and rate movies.
This implies a data-driven application where movies, reviews, and user data are stored and managed.
Loosely Coupled Architecture:

Separation of Concerns:

This design principle involves breaking a program into distinct sections, each addressing a specific concern.
In the context of the course, the separation of concerns is likely referring to the division between client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) code.
Benefits of Loosely Coupled Architecture:

Parallel Development: Teams can work on the frontend and backend independently, allowing for parallel development.
Flexibility: Changes to one part of the system are less likely to affect the other, providing flexibility in terms of technology stack updates or modifications.
Scalability: Each component can scale independently, optimizing performance.
Implementation:

Using different technologies for frontend and backend ensures a diverse skill set among developers.
Frontend might communicate with the backend through APIs, enabling a standardized way of data exchange.
